# millionaires-3.0.0
This is the third version of a simple project I created for practice. It is a console version of a popular game where the player chooses one of four correct answers. The program randomly selects 12 questions from various levels. You need to provide a CSV file in the format: level number;question;correct answer;incorrect answer;incorrect answer;incorrect answer. The file can have any number of questions for each level. The answers will be displayed in random order, and the program will automatically assign them letters A-B-C-D. At each stage of the game, you can use each of the three lifelines once.
